# A/B Testing using Machine Learning

## Introduction

This project bridges the gap between traditional A/B Testing and Machine Learning (ML) to refine digital marketing decisions. We present a step-by-step guide on utilizing data science to enhance the understanding and effectiveness of A/B Testing.

### Motivation

A/B Testing is instrumental in optimizing user interfaces and marketing tactics. Our approach enriches this testing with ML to embrace the intricate patterns of user behavior that standard statistical methods may not fully capture. We seek to bolster user engagement and increase sales by exploiting the subtle dynamics of customer interactions.

### About the Project

This initiative addresses the shortcomings of conventional A/B tests by incorporating an ML perspective. We strive to unravel the complex dimensions of customer behavior to provide a rounded view of the factors influencing user choices.

#### Experiment: "Free Trial" Screener

The experiment conducted by Udacity gauges prospective students' available time to devote to new courses. By utilizing this data, we aim to facilitate the enrollment process and mitigate trial dropouts by managing time-related expectations.

#### Project Goal

Our analysis focuses on pinpointing the key attributes that influence course enrollments and assessing the impact of the "Setting Expectations" form on student signup rates.

Designations within the data are as follows:
- “Experiment = 1” for users who encountered the form.
- “Experiment = 0” for users in the control group who did not.

## Data

The data spans 37 days and includes metrics such as:

- `Date`: The specific day's date.
- `Pageviews`: The count of page views each day.
- `Clicks`: The total daily clicks for the specified page.
- `Enrollments`: The number of enrollments per day.
- `Payments`: The count of daily payments.

### Missing Data and Preprocessing

Our preprocessing steps resolve issues with data quality and readiness for ML analysis, ensuring:

- Merging of control and experimental data with clear identifiers.
- Introduction of a "Day of Week" feature to capture temporal patterns.
- Exclusion of extraneous columns and resolution of missing values.
- Randomization of data to promote model generalizability.

## Machine Learning Models

We evaluate the performance of the following models:

- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- XGBoost

## Key Steps

The project encompasses these core phases:

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Setting up the data for ML application.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualizing and understanding data traits.
- **Feature Engineering**: Crafting features that can better inform model predictions.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Applying ML algorithms and assessing their predictive prowess.

## Prerequisites

- `scikit-learn`
- `xgboost`
- `statsmodels`

## Usage

The provided Jupyter Notebook details each analysis step, enabling replication or adaptation for your datasets. Follow these steps to start:

1. Data acquisition.
2. Preliminary data inspection.
3. Data preparation for model fitting.
4. Model building and validation.

## Running the Analysis

Execute the analysis by launching the Jupyter notebook within the notebook's directory:

```bash
jupyter notebook AB_Testing_using_ML.ipynb

## Conclusion

This project serves as a comprehensive guide for integrating ML into A/B testing frameworks. It demonstrates how ML can be applied to real-world business problems, providing a more nuanced understanding of user behavior and driving more effective business strategies.
